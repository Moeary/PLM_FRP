# Pretrain Language Model-based Ferroptosis-Related Protein Prediction (PLM-FRP)

### Introduction

**Ferroptosis**, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, plays a critical role in various diseases. Accurate identification of ferroptosis-related proteins (FRPs) is crucial for understanding its mechanisms and developing therapeutic strategies. Existing computational methods for FRP prediction often suffer from limited accuracy. In this study, we leverage the power of pre-trained protein language models to develop a novel deep learning model, named FPP, for FRP prediction. By integrating embeddings from ESM2, FPP captures complex relationships within protein sequences, achieving a remarkable 96.09% accuracy on a benchmark dataset, significantly outperforming previous methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art. Our findings suggest that FPP can serve as a powerful tool for FRP prediction and facilitate ferroptosis research. Our study leverages deep learning models to predict FRPs, which can facilitate a deeper understanding of ferroptosis mechanisms and provide guidance for the development of novel ferroptosis regulators.

### Significance

Ferroptosis, a recently discovered form of regulated cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, has emerged as a critical process in various pathologies, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Identifying and characterizing FRPs is paramount for unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying ferroptosis, enabling the development of targeted therapeutic interventions, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. Traditional experimental methods for identifying and characterizing FRPs are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Computational methods, particularly those based on machine learning, offer a promising alternative for large-scale and efficient FRP prediction. Our model, FPP, leverages deep learning and pre-trained protein language models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in FRP prediction, significantly advancing the field of ferroptosis research.
